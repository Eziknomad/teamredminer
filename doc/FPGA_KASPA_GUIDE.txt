TeamRedMiner FPGA Kaspa Guide
=============================

History:
v1.0 2022-10-18 Initial Version.

General Overview
================
Starting in version v0.10.5 TeamRedMiner(TRM) has support for mining Kaspa on
currently supported FPGA platforms: C1100, U50C, FK33, TH53, TH55, E300.  The
Kaspa algorithm is a compute heavy algorithm and does not use the HBM on these
FPGAs.  Due to it being compute heavy it will draw large amounts of core
(vccint) current, and miners should becareful not to exceed their card's power
delivery and cooling capabilities.  Please read the section corresponding to
your hardware below and be aware of the limits of your hardware before testing.
For details on how to start the miner, set voltages and clocks, update firmware
on C1100/U50C, etc see FPGA_GUIDE.txt.


Mining Instructions
===================
Kaspa mining can be started with the 'kas' algorithm.  Example:

sudo ./teamredminer -a kas -o stratum+tcp://pool.woolypooly.com:3112 -u kaspa:qq0vgkm89v3k2plkw2cv9t8wrhcqhpxeunq5ayu9mwjghdavalfggat2hu8nn -p x --fpga_clk_core=200

It is strongly advised to start with a low core clock of around 200MHz and
slowly ramp up from there to ensure you do not exceed your hardware's power
delivery and cooling capabilities.


Clock/Voltage Tuning
==============
With the release of Kaspa, we have also released a new version of the SC
firmware for the C1100 and U50C to allow setting lower voltages on the cards.
Users will likely want to update the TRM firmware on these cards to achieve
optimal results.  For detailed description on how to perform tuning, see the
ethash example in FPGA_GUIDE.txt

Tuning Kaspa is much simpler than ethash since memory is not used.  The only two
variables that play an effect are core clock and core voltage (vccint).  Miners
will want to start with a low clock and voltage and ramp up clock as necessary
until they see error rates increase.  At this point they should either lower the
core clock, or increase the core voltage, until they achieve their desired
performance and efficiency results.  For C1100, U50C, and FK33 we recommend
running with the --debug option to get additional information about the
regulator current outputs and to ensure they do not exceed the cards' limits.

Here is a general tuning process that has worked for us:

1) Start with a low core voltage of 600mV and core clock of 300MHz.

2) Run cards for 5mins to ensure there are no errors and that temperatures are
    stable.  If there are no errors, go to step 3.  Otherwise, go to step 4.

3) If you are below 500MHz, increase core clock by 100MHz.  If you are at or
    above 500MHz, increase core clock by 25MHz. Repeat step 2.

4) If you are seeing errors appearing on some cards you can try to adjust
    settings to reduce the errors by either:
        a) reduce core clock for those FPGAs by 5MHz 
        b) increase vccint for those FGPAs by 5mV
    If your temperatures are exceeding your targets, reduced core clock and/or
    voltage by 5MHz/5mV.

5) Run cards for 5-10 mins and note temperatures and error rates.  If error
    rates or temperatures exceed your targets, repeat step 4.

NOTE: If you see cards crash with jtag errors, you may want to try setting 
        --fpga_max_jtag_mhz=10 as lower voltages can cause the jtag logic to
        not function correctly at higher jtag clock rates.



Tuning Xilinx Varium C1100
==========================
We strongly recommend using an  aftermarket cooling setup on the C1100s before
running Kaspa.  The original passive heatsink will not be sufficient for cooling
the card on this algo.  The VCCINT regulators on the C1100 are rated to 180A.

With good cooling, we typically see most C1100s capable of running 550-600MHz at
600mV vccint.  Typically most cards will work at 575MHz@600mV with a few getting
some errors and need  a little extra tuning.

For more efficiency oriented setups, we find that 550Mhz@575mV is a good
compromise where most cards are happy to run at.



Tuning Xilinx U50C or ECU50
===========================
The frequency and voltage characteristics of this card are essentially the same
as the C1100.  However, U50C and ECU50 users should keep a close eye on total
board power in order to not pull excessive current over the PCIe edge connector.
See your card's retail info for what the maximum safe power to run is for these
boards.  The VCCINT regulators should be rated to 180A.


Tuning SQRL Forest Kitten 33
============================
Unfortunately unmodified FK33s are very limited in their voltage control
capabilities.  The original FK33s can only reduce the vccint voltage to 0.776mV.
This coupled with their 120A rated vccint regulators, will limit the maximum
hashrate and efficiency.  For stock FK33s, we recommend setting the lowest
possible voltage of 0.776mV and not exceeding 475MHz for core clock, at which
point the regulators will roughly be running at the full 120A limit.

For FK33s modified to run voltages down to ~615mV, we find that you can run up
to about 625-650MHz before exceeding the 120A, however you will likely start
seeing errors above roughly 600MHz.


Tuning TUL TH53/TH55
===========================
The TH53/TH55 should be able to supply at least 180A from the vccint regulators.
We suggest checking with manufacturer specs to ensure current ratings.  TRM does
not currently monitor or control voltage settings on TH53/TH55.  Users should
use manufacturer tools to set voltages and monitor current.


Tuning Osprey E300
===========================
The Osprey E300 is rather overbuilt with VCCINT regulators rated to 420A.  Users
with E300s can safely push higher clocks and should just keep an eye on
temperatures.  For high efficiency, we find that most E300s run well at
575MHz@600mV.
